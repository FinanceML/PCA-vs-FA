# PCA-vs-FA
The sheer size of data in the new age is not only a challenge for computer hardware but also the essential bottleneck for the efficiency of many machine learning algorithms. In this issue I describe the diﬀerence between factor models and principal component analysis (PCA).
Both techniques are utilized to “simplify” complex data sets mainly collected of multiple time series as a purpose of a smaller number of time series. The data are daily returns of m = 470 equities on the S&P 500 index from 04.01.2010
through 30.12.2016, for a total of 1762 observations. In this emperical example these time series should be transformed by taking logarithms and/or diﬀerencing to make them approximately stationary.
